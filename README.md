# Code Chronicles: How Joining SDC Taught Me to Speak the Language of Code

*Learning a new skill can be an **exhilarating experience**, especially when that skill is in high demand like programming. Joining SDC to learn new technologies can be a daunting task, but it can also be one of the **most rewarding experiences of your life**. In this blog, I'll be sharing my journey of joining Software Development Centre to learn programming and the lessons I've learned along the way. From the challenges I faced to the triumphs I celebrated, I'll take you on a personal tour of my experience and provide you with some insights that can help you in your own journey.*

I, Diya Baweja, a 1st year student pursuing Btech CSE who, like most of the other students, came into the field of Computer Science just for the sake of my dream and **fascination for the Tech world**. My initial exposure to SDC was through a **training course on Web/App Development** organised by Software Development Centre (SDC). It involved development of the web-app with Frappe, a no-code / low-code Open-Source Web Framework. In this, we developed a **library management app** during the course and a **toy app**( mine Interior Design app) with the help of online guidance by SDC after the course. 

My journey of learning through SDC has been a **rollercoaster ride of highs and lows**, but I wouldn't have it any other way. Earlier I was hardly able to cope up with the ongoing course, being a **novice** to this technology and due to my first semester going on side by side. It was really hard to devote 2 hours for 7 days continuosly from my routine to this course. But gradually through guidance by H.S. Rai Sir and fellow seniors, learning by trial and error, I **succeeded** in making that app acquiring a good hand over this technology. *This experience taught me an important lesson "you don't have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great". *

There was an opportunity, with the course, for the participants that those who secure above 80% in the exam, that was to be conducted after the course, will be given a chance to **become a part** of this prestigious group. I feel really proud to mention that I scored 96.67% in that exam and was chosen as a member of SDC.

Since I was only known to HTML, CSS, and basic python, so Sir suggested me to have a basic knowledge of javascript and also provided with resources for that knowledge. After 10 to 15 days of learning, I was asked to give a **presentation on what I have learnt**. Speaking frankly, I was really nervous as I always looked up to other experienced members who were well-versed with many technologies all being my seniors. But eventually after giving presentation and answering not all but many of the questions asked by everyone, I felt some different **confidence** in myself.
